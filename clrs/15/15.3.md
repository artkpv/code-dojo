# 15.3-2 Why Mergesort is not sped up with DP?

Example:
4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1
4 the same subproblems. Overlapping. Independant subproblems? 

Next: think about how to memoize a solution to subproblem and then use it for another. It 
needs to iterate all elements to determine that it is the same subproblem. So if small number
of the same subproblems then no speed up and even longer.
