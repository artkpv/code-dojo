> Show, by means of a counterexample, that the following "greedy" strategy does not always determine an optimal way to cut rods. Define the **_density_** of a rod of length $i$ to be $p_i / i$, that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of length $n$ cuts off a first piece of length $i$, where $1 \le i \le n$, having maximum density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of length $n - i$.


$r_{n} = d_k  k + r_{n-k}$, where $d_k$ is max. But if there is $k'$ for which $r_{n}$ is greater? 

Example:

$i$     | 1 | 2  | 3   | 4    |
--------|---|----|-----|------|
$p_i$   | 1 | 10 | 11  | 5    |
$p_i/i$ | 1 | 5  | 3.6 | 1.22 |

r_n : 11+1 < 10+10. So cutting the most density piece first leads to not optimal solution.
