Max/min num of elements in a heap of h height? 1+2+2^3+..+2^(h-1)+1..2^h = 2^h-1+1..2^h. Min = 2^h. Max = 2^(h+1)-1

# 6.1-2 
At least 2^h nodes. 2^h = n => h = log(2,n)

Property: A[parent[i]] => A[i] for any i. By induction ... 

# 6.1-4

In max-heap with distinct, where is the smallest? Smallest at j: A[j] < A[i] for any i. A[parent(i)] > A[i] for any i. If j is parent for some i then A[parent(i) = j] < A[i] but that contradict max-heap property. Hence j is not parent for any one. Hence it must be a leaf: last level or second to last if below not filled. 

# 6.1-5

Sorted array - min-heap? 
For sorted: for any i, j, i < j: A[i] <= A[j]. 
For min-heap: A[parent(i)] <= A[i] for any i and parent(i) < i. 
Thus for any i, j in sorted array, min-heap property withholds. Hence it is a min-heap.

23;17;14;6;13;10;1;5;7;12 - max heap ?

      17 14

NO, as 6 not > 7

Leaves are floor(n/2) + 1 , floor(n/2) + 2, ... , n
Leaf - any node that is not a parent for other. 
Left child = i*2, Right child = i*2 + 1, for any i.
Thus, floor(n/2) * 2 = n, the last node. And (floor(n/2) + 1 ) * 2 = n + 2 which is greater than number of nodes. Thus it does not have children. Thus it is a first leaf.
